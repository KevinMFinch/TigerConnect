To setup: download the repo.

Then, in the root directory of the project:
`npm install && cd client && npm install`

Then, open a new tab in the terminal. In one tab, run `npm start` in the root directory in the project. In the other tab, run `npm start` in the client folder. Navigate to localhost:3000 to see the app deployed locally.
